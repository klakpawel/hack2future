# Hackathon Challenge Statements

## 19. Claims Analysis and fraud prediction in the insurance industry

### Challenge Statement
Fraudulent claims cost insurers over $7 billion annually, leading to increased premiums and financial losses.

### Domain
Insurance

### Recommended Technology Stack
Utilizing Fivetran for data integration and Fosfor for predictive analytics.

### Detailed Description
Detecting fraud efficiently is crucial to minimizing these costs, yet traditional methods face challenges such as data silos, manual processes, and outdated systems that hinder accurate and timely analysis.

The challenge is to develop a data-driven AI solution that can:
• Automate data integration from multiple sources into a centralized platform.
• Use AI-powered predictive analytics to detect fraudulent claims more accurately.
• Enhance data transformation and reporting for real-time insights.
• Reduce reliance on manual review and improve operational efficiency.
By leveraging AI and automation, insurers can streamline claims processing, improve fraud detection, and reduce financial losses, ultimately enhancing decision-making and customer satisfaction.

## *18*. Streamline solution for schools through which we will use AI to do all the Homework checking and exam copy evaluation which uses a lot of time of teachers

### Challenge Statement
Teachers spend 23% to 42% of their time evaluating homework and exam sheets, reducing the time available for instruction and student engagement.

### Domain
Ed-tech

### Recommended Technology Stack
A.I, application devlopment(ios and android), React.js , Spring boot

### Detailed Description
Manual grading is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error.

The challenge is to develop an AI-powered evaluation system that can:
• Automate homework and exam assessments to reduce teacher workload.
• Generate detailed performance reports and send them directly to parents.
• Track individual academic growth for better learning insights.
• Integrate seamlessly with school systems to ensure smooth adoption.
This solution aims to streamline evaluation, enhance learning outcomes, and improve efficiency in educational institutions.


## *20*. Recommendation engine to suggest products for cross selling.

### Challenge Statement
In today’s competitive market, businesses seek to maximize sales by offering personalized product recommendations.

### Domain
Insurance

### Recommended Technology Stack
AI/ML, Gen AI, Python, Angular/ React

### Detailed Description
However, challenges in data quality, model selection, and real-time integration often hinder the effectiveness of cross-selling strategies. The challenge is to create a recommendation engine for cross-selling products which can significantly boost sales by suggesting relevant items to customers based on their purchase history and preferences. Here are some key steps to build such an engine:
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize data, and convert categorical data into numerical formats.
2. Feature Engineering: Create features that capture important aspects of the data, such as customer demographics, product categories, and purchase frequency.
3. Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning model.
4. Training the Model: Train the selected model using historical data. Ensure to split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
5. Evaluation: Use metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance. Fine-tune the model based on these metrics.
6. Deployment: Integrate the trained model into your system to start making real-time recommendations.
7. Monitoring and Updating: Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it with new data to maintain accuracy.
By leveraging AI-driven insights, businesses can enhance customer experience, improve sales conversions, and drive revenue growth through effective cross-selling strategies.
