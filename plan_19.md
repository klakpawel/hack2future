# Project Plan: Insurance Claims Fraud Detection System

## Project Overview
**Challenge**: Develop a cloud-native solution for detecting fraudulent insurance claims that addresses data silos, manual processes, and outdated systems.

**Timeline**: 2-day hackathon

**Team**: Cloud engineers with expertise in real-time data processing and machine learning deployment

**Data Schema**: consistent data claims across sources. *build schema conversion pipelines later. 

**data distribution** : 
  80% legitimate claims
  15% "gray area" claims (unusual but not fraudulent)
  5% fraudulent claims with patterns like:
  Multiple claims within short periods
  Unusually high claim amounts
  Claims shortly after policy purchase
  Geographic clustering of suspicious claims

## Selected Data Sources for Implementation

1. **Claims Data** - Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL): High-volume claim submissions with flexible schema for different claim types
2. **Policy Data** - Azure SQL Database: Relational storage for structured policy information with strong consistency
3. **Customer Profiles** - Azure Cache for Redis: Fast in-memory access for frequently accessed customer history
4. **Geographic/Weather Data** - Azure Maps + Blob Storage: Geospatial data with event correlation capabilities
5. **Image/Document Repository** - Azure Blob Storage: Scalable object storage for claim-related documents and images

## Unique Approach: Event-Driven Fraud Detection at the Edge
Unlike traditional centralized fraud detection systems, we will implement a multi-tier architecture with lightweight fraud detection at the edge, combined with deeper analytics in the cloud. This approach provides:

1. **Lower latency** for initial fraud screening
2. **Higher resilience** through distributed processing
3. **Improved scalability** during peak claim periods - warmed up instances
4. **Continued operation** even during connectivity issues - progressive loading and low payload (think about this requirement)

## Cloud-Native Patterns Implemented

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
- Claims processed as events through the system
- Components communicate via message queues
- Loose coupling between services

### 2. Multi-Region Resilience
- Edge components deployed geographically close to claim sources
- Cloud components distributed across availability zones
- Regional failure isolation

### 3. Auto-Scaling
- Serverless functions scale with claim volume
- Container instances adjust based on regional activity
- Database read replicas scale with query load

### 4. Circuit Breaking
- Prevent cascade failures when external services fail
- Graceful degradation when components become unavailable
- Automatic recovery when services restore

### 5. Near-Real-Time Processing
- Stream processing for immediate fraud detection
- Batching for computationally intensive analysis
- Prioritization of high-risk claims

## Demonstration Scenarios

1. **Normal Claim Processing**
   - Show end-to-end processing of legitimate claims
   - Highlight processing speed and data flow

2. **Simple Fraud Detection**
   - Demonstrate edge-based detection of obvious fraud patterns
   - Show alerts and blocking mechanisms

3. **Complex Fraud Pattern**
   - Show how cloud analytics detect subtle fraud patterns
   - Demonstrate how the system learns from historical data

4. **Resilience Test**
   - Simulate cloud connectivity loss
   - Show edge components continuing to function
   - Demonstrate synchronization when connectivity restores

5. **Scaling Demonstration**
   - Show system handling sudden surge in claims (e.g., after a major weather event)
   - Demonstrate resource optimization during quiet periods
